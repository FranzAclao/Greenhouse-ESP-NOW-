ESP-NOW Project: Green Green Grass of Home

This project leverages ESP-NOW to automate essential greenhouse functions, such as:

-Plant Watering
-Lighting Control
-Water Container Management
-Exhaust System

The goal is to enhance your greenhouse's productivity while significantly reducing manual labor.

-------------Getting Started------------------

Customization:

-MAC Addresses
Replace the placeholder MAC addresses in the code with the actual MAC addresses of your ESP32 devices.
Wi-Fi Configuration

-Update the SSID and password in the code to match your network credentials.

-RFID Integration (Optional)
Currently, RFID functionality is not integrated with ESP-NOW.
However, you can easily incorporate it into the system in a way that fits your needs.

Note
You can repurpose the Exhaust System to function as an Automatic Sprinkler for improved irrigation efficiency.

Benefits:
-Fully automated plant care, from watering to environmental control.
-Simple customization to adapt to your specific greenhouse setup.
-Minimal manual intervention needed, allowing you to focus on other tasks.
